## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://fonts.google.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This project helped me understand how to utilize CSS flexbox. This taught me how I can align elements specific to a layout.

I've also learned to use specific units for certain elements such as width, height, fonts, images, etc.

Additionally, learning how to group certain elements together allowed me to use flexbox effectively.
For example,

<div class="card-contents">
  <img src="image-qr-code.png" alt="QR Code navigating to 'frontendmentor.io'">
  <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
  <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
</div>

and setting the css to

.card-contents {
max-width: 36rem;
}

Although I'm not certain if this is the correct approach, things worked out for me.

### Continued development

I would like to understand how to use width more in depth. During the project, I ran into many issues when I'd have my card centered in the webpage, but as soon as I set a max-width in percentage, it was no longer centered. However, changing it to rem solved it.
